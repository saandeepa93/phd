1. One pixel attack to detect fake videos. Paper found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.08864.pdf).

2. As part of extension to the original PhD idea. Build a dataset that will have the combination of [First order motion animation](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/8935-first-order-motion-model-for-image-animation.pdf) combined with audio deep fake so that it clearly mimics the subject.

3. When we want to model complex functions and transforamtion, we use a neural network.

4. **Take the temporal representation of detected action unit and study how the rate of change of each action unit muscle causes the change in emotion.**
