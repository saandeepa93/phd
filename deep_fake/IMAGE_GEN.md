## First order motion model for image animation

### Goals:
1. Model complex motion using self learned keypoints and affine tranformation.
2. Implement occlusion-aware generator to capture the context of the image to
    model object parts that are not visible.
3. Improve estimation of local affine transformation by extending equivariance loss.
