<p>In this paper, the authors estimate the disparity by taking into account the discontinouos property that may occur in two stereo images. The features that are extracted out of these disparity edges are assigned lower weights to exclude any noisy data from the features.</p>
<p>The authors have taken up an intuitive approach to add value to the PSMNet by incorporating their motivation. The detailed experiments and its results support the mentioned contributions.</p>
