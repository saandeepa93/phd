# **Points to remember**

* Emotional is dimensional and continuous in terms of arousal and valence.
* Emotion spans across entire brain and not just regions of it and they are the guiding factors for any cognitive decisions.
* Multivariate pattern analysis using distributed voxels.
* Brain fluctuates between different emotional states over course of delta time.
* Body plays an important role in emotion.
* Salience and value instead of valence and arousal.
* Valence can be stimulated through contact.
* Aversiveness elicits stronger responses in neurons than appetitive.
* Visual attention also depends on personal history.
