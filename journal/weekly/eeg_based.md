# **Multimodal modelling of emotional expressiveness**
## **1. Dataset**
* Audio transcribed
* NEO-FFI to record personality traits (self reported)
* Questionaire to determine the personality traits of a the person. 

## Measuring expressiveness
### Questionaire
* Annotators watch the video of participants and answer a series of 12 questions. A subset of 4 motivates the paper.
* Each question was assigned to a set of annotators.
* High ICC for inter rater reliability

### Latent variable modelling 
* Conformatory factor analysis (CFA)
* Latent variable shows pattern with Extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism

## Measuring behaviour
* What do they mean by behavioural modalities and behavioural signals in their contribution. end of page 5
